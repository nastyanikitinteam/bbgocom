        <b>
          This document and the other documents we refer to below constitute our
          set of rules, or what we officially refer to as our terms of use (for
          short, "Terms").
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The terms and conditions are a binding contract between you and BBGO. If
        you live in North America or South America, the contract is between you
        and BBGO, Inc.; if you live in any other country, the contract is
        between you and Etsy Ireland UC, a subsidiary of BBGO, Inc. In the
        following, we will use the name "BBGO" to refer collectively to BBGO,
        Inc. and all of its subsidiaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          Please note this section 11. Disputes with BBGO contain an arbitration
          clause and class action waiver. By accepting the Terms, you agree to
          resolve all disputes through binding arbitration. This means that you
          waive the right to have these disputes resolved by a judge or jury and
          the right to participate in a class action, class arbitration or
          representative action.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        This contract defines our rights and obligations when you use etsy.com,
        Pattern by BBGO, and other mobile applications among the BBGO services
        (we will use the term "Services" below), so please read it carefully. By
        using any of our Services (even if you simply visit one of our sites),
        you agree to the terms. If you don't agree to the terms, you will not be
        able to use our services. Do you like it? Good, read on!
      </p>
      <h3>2. Requirements for advertisements</h3>
      <h4>The announcement must be legal</h4>
      <p>
        You may only post advertisements for goods, services, jobs, facilities
        and other offers (hereinafter "goods") for which you have all necessary
        rights, licenses, registrations, permits, certificates, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is your responsibility to make sure that all elements of the ad
        (including photos, videos, links to third-party sites when they are
        allowed, etc.) are legitimate before you post it. You will be solely
        responsible for any violations of law or third-party rights that you
        commit.
      </p>
      <h4>The information in the ad must be accurate and complete</h4>
      <p>
        If your proposal is required by law to contain any information, you must
        include it.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for distributing ads that lack the required
        information or contain incorrect information.
      </p>
      <h3>3. Your privacy</h3>
      <p>
        We know that your personal information is important to you, so it's
        important to us. Our <a href="/">Privacy Policy</a> describes how your
        data is collected, used and shared when you use our services. By using
        our services, you also agree that we may process your data in the ways
        outlined in the <a href="/">Privacy Policy</a>, so please read it.
      </p>
      <p>
        BBGO and sellers process members' personal data (e.g., buyer's name,
        email address, and shipping address) and are therefore considered a
        separate and independent controller of the buyer's personal data under
        EU law. This means that each party is responsible for the personal data
        it processes when providing services. For example, if a seller
        inadvertently discloses a buyer's name and email address while
        fulfilling another buyer's order, the seller, not BBGO, will be liable
        for such unauthorized disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if you are found to be a joint data controller with BBGO with
        respect to customer personal data, and if BBGO is sued, fined or
        otherwise incurred expenses due to your actions as a joint controller of
        customer personal data, you agree to reimburse BBGO for the costs
        associated with your processing of customer personal data. See Section
        9. "<a href="/">Indemnification</a> (or what happens if we get sued
        because of you)" below for more information about BBGO indemnification
        obligations.
      </p>
      <h3>4. Your BBGO account</h3>
      <p>
        <b>
          You'll need to create an BBGO account in order to use some of our
          services. Here are a few rules about BBGO accounts.
        </b>
      </p>
      <h4>A. You must be 18 years old or older to use our services.</h4>
      <p>
        Minors under the age of 18 and over the age of 13 are permitted to use
        BBGO services through a parent's or legal guardian's account with proper
        authorization and under direct supervision. Children under the age of 13
        are not permitted to use BBGO or the services. All activities under your
        account performed by a minor are your responsibility. There may be
        commercial products or services available that you may consider as a
        means of restricting minors' access to material on the Internet. For
        more information, see. BBGO <a href="">Minors Policy</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>B. Be honest with us.</h4>
      <p>
        Provide accurate information about yourself. Do not use inaccurate
        information or impersonate another person or company using your account.
      </p>
      <h4>C. Select an appropriate name.</h4>
      <p>
        If you do not wish to use your full name as the name associated with
        your account, you will be prohibited from using abusive, vulgar language
        that violates anyone's intellectual property rights or otherwise
        violates the Terms of Use.
      </p>
      <h4>D. You are responsible for your account.</h4>
      <p>
        You are solely responsible for any activity under your account. If you
        share an account with others, the person whose financial information is
        listed on the account will ultimately be responsible for any actions. If
        you are registering as a legal entity, you personally guarantee that you
        have the authority to agree to the terms on behalf of the company. In
        addition, your accounts are non-transferable.
      </p>
      <h4>E. Protect your password.</h4>
      <p>
        As stated above, you are solely responsible for any activity under your
        account, so it is important to keep your account password secure. This
        is a help article on how to make your account more secure.
      </p>
      <h4>F. Let's be clear about our relationship.</h4>
      <p>
        These terms do not create any intermediary, partnership, employment, or
        joint venture or franchisee relationship between you and BBGO.
      </p>
      <h3>5. Your content</h3>
      <p>
        <b>
          The content you publish using our services is your content (so we will
          refer to it as "your content"). We do not claim it to include anything
          that is published using our services (e.g., store names, profile
          pictures, product photos, product descriptions, reviews, comments,
          videos, usernames, etc.).
        </b>
      </p>
      <h4>A. Responsibility for your content.</h4>
      <p>
        You understand that you are solely responsible for your content. You
        represent that you have all necessary rights in all of your content and
        that you are not infringing on the rights of third parties by publishing
        it.
      </p>
      <h4>B. Permission to use your content.</h4>
      <p>
        By publishing your content through our services, you grant BBGO a
        license to use your content. We do not claim any ownership rights in
        your content, but you give us permission to use it for BBGO operations
        and development. In this way, we will not infringe any rights you have
        over your content and can help promote it. For example, you acknowledge
        and agree that BBGO may, on occasion, make promotional offers to you or
        Etsy customers on the site that may be relevant to your products.
      </p>
      <h4>C. The rights you grant BBGO.</h4>
      <p>
        (The legal wording of the previous section). By posting your content,
        you grant Etsy a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable,
        sublicensable, perpetual license to use, display, edit, modify,
        reproduce, distribute, store and prepare derivative works of your
        content. This allows us to provide the services and promote BBGO, your
        BBGO store or the services in general, in any formats and through any
        channels, including any BBGO services, our partners or a third-party
        site or advertising distribution medium. You agree not to assert any
        moral rights or right of publicity against us for use of your content.
        You also acknowledge our legitimate interest in using it in accordance
        with the scope of this license if your content contains any personal
        information.
