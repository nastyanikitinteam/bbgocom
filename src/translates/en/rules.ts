        <h4>The announcement must be legal</h4>
        <p>
          You may only post advertisements for goods, services, jobs, facilities
          and other offers (hereinafter "goods") for which you have all necessary
          rights, licenses, registrations, permits, certificates, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is your responsibility to make sure that all elements of the ad
          (including photos, videos, links to third-party sites when they are
          allowed, etc.) are legitimate before you post it. You will be solely
          responsible for any violations of law or third-party rights that you
          commit.
        </p>
        <h4>The information in the ad must be accurate and complete</h4>
        <p>
          If your proposal is required by law to contain any information, you must
          include it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are solely responsible for distributing ads that lack the required
          information or contain incorrect information.

      title: "Your privacy",
      content: `
        <p>
          We know that your personal information is important to you, so it's
          important to us. Our <a href="/">Privacy Policy</a> describes how your
          data is collected, used and shared when you use our services. By using
          our services, you also agree that we may process your data in the ways
          outlined in the <a href="/">Privacy Policy</a>, so please read it.
        </p>
        <p>
          BBGO and sellers process members' personal data (e.g., buyer's name,
          email address, and shipping address) and are therefore considered a
          separate and independent controller of the buyer's personal data under
          EU law. This means that each party is responsible for the personal data
          it processes when providing services. For example, if a seller
          inadvertently discloses a buyer's name and email address while
          fulfilling another buyer's order, the seller, not BBGO, will be liable
          for such unauthorized disclosure.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if you are found to be a joint data controller with BBGO with
          respect to customer personal data, and if BBGO is sued, fined or
          otherwise incurred expenses due to your actions as a joint controller of
          customer personal data, you agree to reimburse BBGO for the costs
          associated with your processing of customer personal data. See Section
          9. "<a href="/">Indemnification</a> (or what happens if we get sued
          because of you)" below for more information about BBGO indemnification
          obligations.

            You'll need to create an BBGO account in order to use some of our
            services. Here are a few rules about BBGO accounts.
          </b>
        </p>
        <h4>A. You must be 18 years old or older to use our services.</h4>
        <p>
          Minors under the age of 18 and over the age of 13 are permitted to use
          BBGO services through a parent's or legal guardian's account with proper
          authorization and under direct supervision. Children under the age of 13
          are not permitted to use BBGO or the services. All activities under your
          account performed by a minor are your responsibility. There may be
          commercial products or services available that you may consider as a
          means of restricting minors' access to material on the Internet. For
          more information, see. BBGO <a href="">Minors Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>B. Be honest with us.</h4>
        <p>
          Provide accurate information about yourself. Do not use inaccurate
          information or impersonate another person or company using your account.
        </p>
        <h4>C. Select an appropriate name.</h4>
        <p>
          If you do not wish to use your full name as the name associated with
          your account, you will be prohibited from using abusive, vulgar language
          that violates anyone's intellectual property rights or otherwise
          violates the Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <h4>D. You are responsible for your account.</h4>
        <p>
          You are solely responsible for any activity under your account. If you
          share an account with others, the person whose financial information is
          listed on the account will ultimately be responsible for any actions. If
          you are registering as a legal entity, you personally guarantee that you
          have the authority to agree to the terms on behalf of the company. In
          addition, your accounts are non-transferable.
        </p>
        <h4>E. Protect your password.</h4>
        <p>
          As stated above, you are solely responsible for any activity under your
          account, so it is important to keep your account password secure. This
          is a help article on how to make your account more secure.
        </p>
        <h4>F. Let's be clear about our relationship.</h4>
        <p>
          These terms do not create any intermediary, partnership, employment, or
          joint venture or franchisee relationship between you and BBGO.
